Documentary Description of the War Card Game

Introduction to the Game

The War Card Game is a strategic card game that blends elements of luck, tactics, and resource management. It is designed for two players, one being human (referred to as the *User*) and the other, an AI-controlled computer opponent. The goal of the game is to outplay your opponent by winning rounds, collecting gold, and using that gold to improve your deck through strategic trades. The ultimate objective is to either wipe out the opposing player or emerge as the last survivor by managing your cards wisely.

1. The Setup: Card Distribution and Initial Conditions

At the start of each game:

- Deck Setup: A deck of 52 cards is divided into two hands—one for the user and the other for the computer. Each card has a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades, Stars, Moons) and a rank (from 2 to Ace, plus special cards like Dragon, Phoenix, and Wizard).
- Initial Card Distribution: The player starts with a set number of cards drawn randomly, while the computer also receives its own cards (the computer has 15 cards, and the user starts with 8 cards). The user’s deck may be reshuffled before each round.

2. The Gameplay: Rounds and Battle Mechanics

Each round of the game plays out as follows:

1. Card Draw: Both players draw a card from their hand. The cards are placed on the battlefield, and each card has a value assigned to it based on its rank (2-17, with special cards like Phoenix and Dragon having higher values).
  
2. Battle Units: Each card’s value is multiplied by a random factor (between 1 and 10) to determine its battle strength, called *units*. The player with the highest unit total wins the round.
  
3. Winning and Losing the Round: The winner of the round takes both cards. The loser, however, suffers a permanent loss of a random number of cards from their hand. The winner retains their old cards and gains the new ones, but they don’t receive any new cards after each round. This cycle continues until a player runs out of cards or the game ends.

4. Gold Earning: Gold is awarded to the winner based on the number of units they had above the opponent’s total. Gold can then be used in the trade shop for card improvements, allowing the player to purchase new cards to add to their hand.

3. The Trade Shop: Card Exchange

After each round, the game provides the option to access a Trade Shop where players can exchange gold for cards. Here’s how it works:

- Trade Shop Menu: The shop displays a selection of powerful cards that can be purchased using the gold earned from winning rounds. The cards may include powerful entities like "Dragon of Spades" or "Ace of Hearts," each with high battle values.
  
- Card Prices: Each card has a price, and players can purchase cards to strengthen their deck or prepare for future rounds. Players must be strategic in their spending as gold is limited, and the risk of losing cards makes it vital to bolster their hand whenever possible.

- Trading Restrictions: Players can only trade cards after the round ends. During the round, trading is not allowed, maintaining the flow of the game and adding an element of pressure to each decision.

4. Permanent Card Loss and Elimination

One of the core features of the game is the **permanent loss of cards**:

- Losing Cards: When a player loses a round, they lose a random number of cards from their hand. These cards are permanently removed from the game and cannot be reclaimed.
  
- Game Continuation: If the computer opponent runs out of cards, it is replaced by a new AI with a fresh hand of 15 cards. The game continues, but the player must face new challenges and adapt to the new computer's strategy.

- Player's Strategy: This mechanic forces both players to balance between winning rounds, trading, and managing the number of cards they have left. Players must weigh the risk of trading cards for better ones versus the possibility of being forced to lose cards in a future round.

5. Card Retention and Game Continuity

The most crucial aspect of the game is the retention of cards:

- Card Retention: The winner of a round retains all the cards they started with and the ones they won in the round. This retention mechanic ensures that the game doesn’t become too fast-paced, allowing players to build and strengthen their hands over time.
  
- Exiting the Game: At any time, the player can opt to exit the game. If they decide to continue, they advance to the next round or choose to trade cards in the shop. However, the game is designed to offer a sense of progression—facing new AI opponents as the game continues and providing opportunities to trade or eliminate enemies.

6. The End of the Game: Victory or Defeat

The game can end in multiple ways:

- Computer Elimination: If the AI computer opponent loses all its cards, it is eliminated and replaced with a new computer player. This creates a cycle of challenges for the player.
  
- Player Victory: The player wins when they defeat the final computer opponent and choose to exit the game with their accumulated gold and cards. The player can also choose to continue playing in an endless loop until they decide to stop.

Key Features & Mechanics Recap

1. Strategic Depth: The game offers strategic depth in terms of card selection, battle choices, and how to spend gold in the trade shop. Each decision matters.
   
2. Gold Economy: Gold is earned after winning rounds and can be used in the trade shop to improve your deck. The player’s strategy with gold determines how well they can prepare for future rounds.

3. Card Retention and Permanent Loss: After winning a round, players retain their old cards and the ones they win. Losers lose a random number of cards permanently, shaping the gameplay.

4. AI Replacement: When the computer runs out of cards, it is replaced by a new, randomly generated AI with a fresh deck. This keeps the game exciting and unpredictable.

5. Exiting and Restarting: Players can choose to exit the game at any point, but can also restart or continue to the next round, facing increasingly tougher challenges.
